# CHIGEE XR-2 OBD PROJECT MILESTONES

## 🎯 PROJECT GOAL
Clone existing OBD module functionality to create custom ESP32 BLE OBD-II server that connects directly to Chigee XR-2 display, bypassing phone bridge approach.

## 📊 MAJOR MILESTONES ACHIEVED

### 1. XR-2 OBD SUPPORT CONFIRMATION ✅
- **Status**: CONFIRMED by Chigee support
- **Finding**: XR-2 DOES support OBD module connection
- **Impact**: Validated direct hardware approach vs phone bridge

### 2. XR-2 BLE PROTOCOL DISCOVERY ✅ 
- **Tool**: blexploit BLE exploitation framework
- **Discovery**: XR-2 operates in dual-mode:
  - Classic Bluetooth: `CHIGEE-6697` (MAC: 34:76:5a:02:c0:33)
  - **BLE Mode**: `CHIGEE-6697-le` (MAC: C0:76:5A:02:C0:33)
- **Critical**: XR-2 uses BLE for OBD, not Classic BT

### 3. XR-2 GATT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS ✅
- **Method**: blexploit GATT enumeration
- **Key Finding**: Custom OBD service UUID discovered
- **Service**: `0000aaa1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Characteristic**: `30312d30-3030-302d-3261-616130303030`
- **Properties**: read, write, notify

### 4. ESP32 BLE SERVER IMPLEMENTATION ✅
- **Platform**: PlatformIO with ESP32 BLE Arduino
- **Device Name**: `CGOBD-5F72`
- **Service UUID**: `30312d30-3030-302d-3261-616130303030` (matching XR-2)
- **Characteristic**: `30312d31-3030-302d-3261-616130303030`
- **Status**: Successfully advertising and discoverable

### 5. XR-2 ↔ ESP32 CONNECTION SUCCESS ✅
- **Achievement**: XR-2 successfully pairs with ESP32
- **Connection**: Stable BLE connection established
- **Evidence**: ESP32 serial logs show "🎉 XR-2 CONNECTED!"
- **Duration**: Connection maintained consistently

### 6. OBD PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION ✅
- **Standard**: ELM327 command emulation over BLE
- **PIDs Supported**: 
  - 010C: Engine RPM
  - 010D: Vehicle Speed  
  - 0105: Engine Temperature
  - 0142: Battery Voltage
  - 010B: MAP Pressure
  - Plus additional diagnostic PIDs
- **Format**: Standard OBD-II response format (41 XX YY YY)

### 7. BLE TRAFFIC MONITORING SETUP ✅
- **Tool**: Custom Python BLE scanner using bleak library
- **Capability**: Real-time GATT notification monitoring
- **Connection**: Successfully connected to XR-2 BLE
- **Monitoring**: Active on characteristic `30312d30-3030-302d-3261-616130303030`

## 🔍 CURRENT OBSERVATIONS

### ESP32 → XR-2 Data Flow ✅
- ESP32 sends complete OBD data frames
- Format: `41 0C 1A F8 41 0D 3C 41 05 5A 41 42 34 80 41 0B 63`
- Transmission: Both setValue() and notify() methods used
- Frequency: Every 2-3 seconds

### XR-2 → ESP32 Traffic Analysis 🔍
- **BLE Scanner Result**: NO notifications captured from XR-2
- **Observation**: XR-2 appears to be passive reader only
- **Hypothesis**: XR-2 reads characteristic value rather than sending commands
- **Status**: Needs further verification

### XR-2 Dashboard Status ❓
- **Current State**: Unknown if OBD data is displayed
- **Testing Needed**: Visual verification of XR-2 OBD dashboard
- **Expected**: RPM, Speed, Engine Temp should show values

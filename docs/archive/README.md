- `PHASE1_INTELLIGENCE_ANALYSIS.md` - Early firmware analysis attempts
- `FIRMWARE_ANALYSIS.md` - Preliminary analysis tools and methodology  
- `BLEXPLOIT_SETUP.md` - BLE analysis tool setup (superseded by breakthrough)
- `TRAFFIC_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY.md` - Traffic analysis methodology (superseded)

### **Future Features** (Not Yet Implemented)
- `CARPLAY_OBD_SOLUTION.md` - CarPlay integration plans
- `CROSS_DEVICE_TESTING_PLAN.md` - Multi-device testing strategy
- `ADVANCED_SECURITY_SUMMARY.md` - Advanced security considerations

## üìã **Why Archived**

These files were archived because:

```

## Usage Examples

### Check Current Status
```
> PHASE STATUS
=== PROJECT STATUS ===
Current Phase: 2 - Isolation Testing
Progress: 65.0%
Validated: NO

Phase Completion:
? Phase 0: Planning & Design
? Phase 1: Hardware Prototype
?? Phase 2: Isolation Testing
? Phase 3: CAN Bus Integration
...
```

### Add Progress
```
> PHASE PROGRESS 10
Progress updated: 75.0%
```

### Validate Current Phase
```
> PHASE VALIDATE
Phase validation: FAILED
=== CURRENT PHASE REQUIREMENTS ===
Phase: Isolation Testing
? Hardware Ready: YES
? Software Compiled: YES
? Safety Tests: YES
? Bluetooth: YES
? CAN Simulation: NO
```

### Run Diagnostics
```
> TEST
=== RUNNING SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS ===
Bluetooth test... ? PASS (Client connected)
Memory test... ? PASS (87432 bytes free)
Simulation test... ? PASS (Simulation data generated)
Phase validation test... ? FAIL (Phase requirements not met)
Safety systems test... ? PASS (Safety systems nominal)
=== DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE ===
??  Some tests FAILED - check system
```

## Automatic Progress Tracking

The system automatically tracks progress through:

- **OBD Command Processing**: +1% every 10 commands
- **Successful Diagnostics**: +5% per test passed
- **Phase Validation**: +5% when requirements met
- **Time-based (Test Mode)**: +2% every 30 seconds

## Safety Features

- Phase validation prevents unsafe advancement
- Automatic fallback to test mode on CAN errors
- Emergency disconnect functionality
- Memory monitoring and cleanup
- Safety system diagnostics

## Integration with Existing Code

The phase management system is seamlessly integrated:
